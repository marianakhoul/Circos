# Image 1

The image shows the links between chromosomes for Structural Variant data. 

The input file segdup.bundle1.txt file has the following format
```
chr1 10 20 chr2 400 450 color=blue
chr3 1029 2000 chr14 88292982 9292881 color=pink
```
Each type of structural variant was given a color and the ones which weren't of importance got the color black.

The Karyotype file used for the bands around the image were from the circos package found in data/karyotype/karyotype.human.hg19.txt since the data was mapped to hg19.
